# Payment Integration Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of payment processing for ticket purchases.

## Payment Provider Options

### 1. Paystack / Opay Integration

- Most popular and widely supported
- Excellent developer tools and documentation
- Strong security and compliance features
- Support for multiple payment methods

### 2. PayPal Integration

- Widely recognized and trusted
- Good for international transactions
- Built-in buyer protection

### 3. Flutterwave (Africa-focused)

- Strong presence in African markets
- Support for local payment methods
- Multi-currency support

## Recommended Approach: Paystack / Opay

### Rationale

- Comprehensive API documentation
- Excellent React/Next.js support
- Strong security compliance (PCI DSS)
- Flexible for future expansion
- Good support for subscription models if needed later

## Implementation Components

### 1. Payment Service

- `processPayment()` - Function to handle payment processing
- `createPaymentIntent()` - Function to create Paystack / Opay payment intents
- `handlePaymentSuccess()` - Function to handle successful payments
- `handlePaymentFailure()` - Function to handle failed payments

### 2. Checkout Flow

1. User selects tickets and proceeds to checkout
2. System creates a payment intent with Paystack / Opay
3. User enters payment details in Paystack / Opay checkout form
4. Paystack / Opay processes the payment
5. System receives webhook confirmation
6. Tickets are generated and stored in database
7. User receives confirmation email

### 3. Security Considerations

- Never handle raw card data in the application
- Use Paystack / Opay's hosted checkout or Elements for secure payment forms
- Implement proper webhook validation
- Store only necessary payment information

### 4. Webhook Handling

- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Confirm payment and generate tickets
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Handle payment failure
- `charge.refunded` - Handle refunds

### 5. Refund System

- Allow event creators to issue refunds
- Implement refund policies
- Handle partial refunds for multi-ticket purchases

## Data Model Extensions

### Payment Records Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  ticket_id UUID REFERENCES tickets(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  currency TEXT DEFAULT 'USD',
  payment_intent_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending', -- 'succeeded', 'failed', 'refunded'
  payment_method TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up Paystack / Opay account and obtain API keys
2. Install Paystack / Opay SDK in the project
3. Create payment service functions
4. Implement checkout flow
5. Set up webhook endpoints
6. Handle payment success/failure scenarios
7. Implement refund functionality
8. Add payment history to user dashboard
