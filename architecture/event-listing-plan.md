# Event Listing and Search Functionality Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of event listing and search functionality for users to discover events.

## Components

### 1. Event Listing Page

- Grid/list view of published events
- Pagination for performance
- Sorting options (date, popularity, price)
- Filtering capabilities

### 2. Search Functionality

- Full-text search across event titles and descriptions
- Filter by location, date range, price range
- Category/tag filtering
- Real-time search suggestions

### 3. Event Service Methods

- `getEvents()` - Function to fetch events with filters
- `searchEvents()` - Function to search events by keyword
- `getEventById()` - Function to fetch a specific event
- `getEventsByCreator()` - Function to fetch events by creator

### 4. Filtering Options

- Date range (today, this week, this month, custom range)
- Location (geographic proximity, city, venue)
- Price range (free, paid)
- Category/tags
- Event status (upcoming, happening now, past)

### 5. Sorting Options

- Date (soonest first, furthest first)
- Popularity (most tickets sold)
- Price (lowest first, highest first)
- Title (alphabetical)

### 6. Performance Considerations

- Server-side pagination
- Database indexing for search fields
- Caching of frequently accessed data
- Lazy loading for images

### 7. UI Components

- Search bar with autocomplete
- Filter sidebar/drawer
- Sort dropdown
- Event cards with key information
- Pagination controls

### 8. Data Model for Search

```typescript
interface EventFilter {
  searchQuery?: string;
  location?: string;
  startDate?: Date;
  endDate?: Date;
  minPrice?: number;
  maxPrice?: number;
  categories?: string[];
  sortBy?: "date" | "popularity" | "price" | "title";
  sortOrder?: "asc" | "desc";
  page?: number;
  limit?: number;
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Create event listing page layout
2. Implement search and filter components
3. Develop API service methods for fetching events
4. Add pagination functionality
5. Implement sorting options
6. Optimize database queries with proper indexing
7. Add loading states and error handling
8. Implement caching strategies
