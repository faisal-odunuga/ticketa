2. Supabase Auth creates user account
3. Profile record created in database
4. Welcome email sent

### Event Creation

1. Event creator fills event form
2. Data validated on frontend
3. Event data sent to Supabase
4. Banner image uploaded to Storage
5. Event record created in database

### Ticket Purchase

1. User selects event and tickets
2. Payment initiated through Paystack / Opay
3. Payment processed and confirmed
4. Ticket records created in database
5. QR codes generated and stored
6. Confirmation sent to user

### Ticket Validation

- Efficient file organization
- Automatic cleanup of unused files

### Caching

- Redis for session caching
- CDN for static assets
- Database query caching
