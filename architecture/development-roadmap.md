  I've completed the architectural planning for your event ticketing app using Supabase. Here's what I've accomplished:

## Database Schema Design

- Defined tables for users, profiles, events, tickets, and payments
- Set up relationships between tables with proper foreign keys
- Planned storage buckets for event banners and ticket QR codes

## Core Feature Architecture

I've created detailed implementation plans for all major components:

1. **Authentication System** - Using Supabase Auth with role-based access control
2. **Event Creation Functionality** - Forms, validation, and storage integration
3. **Ticket Purchasing** - Shopping cart, checkout flow, and payment processing
4. **User Dashboards** - Separate dashboards for event creators and ticket buyers
5. **Payment Integration** - Paystack / Opay integration with webhook handling
6. **Image Storage** - Supabase Storage integration with optimization
7. **Event Discovery** - Search, filtering, and listing functionality
8. **Ticket Validation** - QR code generation and validation system

## System Architecture

- Created a comprehensive system architecture with diagrams
- Defined data flow for all major operations
- Planned security considerations and scalability approaches
